"CDK-rst+top" content:

The data is organized by the type of ligand (Orthosteric and Allosteric) and the phase it was used in (Train or Test).

For each complex, a specific folder (named "<subfamily>_<PDB>") contains:
- the solvated topology file,
- the production script,
- four AMBER restart files (one for each replica),

all used for the production step of our Molecular Dynamics simulations.
