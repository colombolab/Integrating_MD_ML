# Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning for Kinase ligands classifier.
The following folder contains the supplementary material for the paper "Integrating Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict the Functional Profile of Kinase Ligands" by Frasnetti, Cucchi et al.
In detail, it contains:
- AMBER topologies and restart files for each of the protein-ligand complexes used for both training and testing.
- python codes used for dataset generation, training and testing. For more details on the versions of python libraries used please refer to the "Note" section in the paper.
- Tanimoto similarity calculations for the ligands in the train and test datasets.
